# Homework 1

This is my first project for N423: Database Development for Mobile Apps.

# Purpose

This project is a basic weather forecast app that allows users to input their desired city and set range of days (no more than three) to quickly view the current and upcoming weather in that area using the weatherapi.com API. This is to get acquainted with the basics of using and gathering JSON data from an API.

# Tasks

In this project, I have...

- created a responsive web page that dynamically loads and adjusts to external content,
- styled using SASS,
- retreieved all data as API JSON data from weatherapi.com,
- included an input box for users to manually type their desired city,
- included a "Log in" button (unusable),
- included a selection input for users to manually select their desired date range/see a set number of days in a forecast,
- included 80% of the API JSON data under the free/basic plan,
- uploaded the project to the Web4 server,
- uploaded the project to Github, and
- submited the project with the link to the Github repo.
