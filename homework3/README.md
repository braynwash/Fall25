# Homework 3

This is my second web project for N423: Database Development for Mobile Apps.

# Purpose

This project is a simple "database" application where users can add a student into their local storage. Upon request, the application can display names and other inputted information that has already been saved into the storage.

# Tasks

In this project, I have...

- created a responsive web page that dynamically loads and displays internally saved content,
- styled using SASS and made content easy to read,
- allowed users to input information in a form,
- stored information within local storage,
- organized the visible data in an easy-to-read way,
- uploaded the project to the Web4 server,
- uploaded the project to Github, and
- submited the project with the link to the Github repo.
